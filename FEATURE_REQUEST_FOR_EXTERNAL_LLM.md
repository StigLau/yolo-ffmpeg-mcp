# ü§ñ Feature Request for External LLM Analysis

## üìã Context & Problem Statement

We have built a sophisticated MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for intelligent video editing with 24+ tools. After analyzing real workflow usage, we've identified significant efficiency gaps. We need an external LLM to evaluate our proposed solutions and suggest additional improvements.

## üéØ Current System Overview

**What we have built:**
- 24 production-ready MCP tools for video editing
- Natural language ‚Üí komposition.json ‚Üí build plan ‚Üí video workflow
- Beat-synchronized music video creation (120-140 BPM support)  
- AI-powered content analysis and scene detection
- Frame-accurate concatenation and transition effects
- Complete speech-synchronized video workflows

**Current workflow complexity:**
```
User Request ‚Üí list_files() ‚Üí generate_komposition_from_description() ‚Üí 
create_build_plan_from_komposition() ‚Üí validate_build_plan_for_bpms() ‚Üí 
process_komposition_file() ‚Üí Final Video
```

**Performance data:**
- 5 sequential MCP calls required for basic video creation
- 2+ minutes processing time for simple requests
- 15+ parameters across the workflow
- 8+ intermediate files generated
- High cognitive overhead for users

## üö® Identified Problems & Proposed Solutions

### **Problem 1: Excessive API Call Complexity**
**Current**: 5 sequential calls to create a simple music video
**Proposed**: Single `create_video_from_description()` atomic operation
**Question for LLM**: Is this the right level of abstraction? Should we have multiple atomic operations for different complexity levels?

### **Problem 2: Natural Language Processing Gaps**
**Current**: "Make a video with intro, verse and refrain" ‚Üí generates only 2 generic segments
**Proposed**: Enhanced musical structure recognition and automatic segment generation
**Question for LLM**: What are the best practices for parsing complex creative intent from natural language? How can we better handle ambiguous or conflicting requirements?

### **Problem 3: Parameter Inconsistency**
**Current**: Mixed parameter names (`komposition_file` vs `komposition_path`)
**Proposed**: Standardized naming conventions and smart parameter inference
**Question for LLM**: What parameter design patterns work best for complex, multi-step workflows?

### **Problem 4: Limited Error Recovery**
**Current**: Workflow failures require starting from scratch
**Proposed**: Stateful workflow management with resumption capabilities
**Question for LLM**: How should we design error recovery for long-running creative workflows?

## üéØ Specific Questions for External LLM

### **1. API Design Philosophy**
**Context**: We're balancing simplicity (few powerful tools) vs flexibility (many granular tools)

**Questions:**
- Should we prioritize atomic "do everything" operations or maintain granular control?
- How do successful creative software APIs handle this complexity trade-off?
- What's the optimal number of tools for a creative workflow API?

### **2. Natural Language Intent Parsing**
**Context**: Users express creative intent using musical, cinematic, and aesthetic terminology

**Questions:**
- How can we better parse creative language like "leica-like", "smooth transitions", "8 beat transitions"?
- What are proven techniques for handling ambiguous creative requirements?
- Should we implement conversational clarification when intent is unclear?

### **3. Workflow State Management**
**Context**: Video creation is inherently iterative with potential for long processing times

**Questions:**
- What are best practices for managing long-running creative workflows?
- How should we handle workflow resumption after failures or parameter changes?
- What information should we persist vs recompute?

### **4. Parameter Design Patterns**
**Context**: Our tools have complex parameter sets that users struggle with

**Questions:**
- How can we implement effective parameter defaults for creative workflows?
- What's the best way to handle parameter dependencies and validation?
- Should we use typed parameters, string-based parameters, or hybrid approaches?

### **5. User Experience Optimization**
**Context**: Our users range from technical developers to creative professionals

**Questions:**
- How do we design APIs that work well for both human users and AI agents?
- What level of abstraction works best for creative tool APIs?
- How should we handle the tension between powerful features and ease of use?

### **6. Performance and Scalability**
**Context**: Video processing is computationally expensive with highly variable completion times

**Questions:**
- How should we design APIs for operations that might take seconds or hours?
- What are best practices for progress reporting in creative workflows?
- How can we optimize for both throughput and responsiveness?

## üîç Advanced Problem Areas Needing Analysis

### **1. Multi-Modal Content Understanding**
**Challenge**: We need to process video, audio, images, and text together
**Current gap**: Limited cross-modal analysis and intelligent content matching
**Question**: How can we improve AI-driven content analysis and automatic source file selection?

### **2. Creative Constraint Satisfaction**
**Challenge**: Users often have competing requirements (duration vs content, quality vs speed)
**Current gap**: No intelligent constraint resolution
**Question**: How should creative tools handle conflicting user requirements?

### **3. Style Transfer and Aesthetic Control**
**Challenge**: Users request aesthetic styles ("leica-like", "cinematic", "vintage")
**Current gap**: Limited automatic style application
**Question**: What's the best approach for mapping aesthetic descriptions to technical parameters?

### **4. Temporal Synchronization Complexity**
**Challenge**: Beat-synchronized video requires precise timing calculations
**Current gap**: BPM changes mid-composition, tempo variations, complex musical structures
**Question**: How can we handle advanced musical timing scenarios?

### **5. Collaborative Workflow Support**
**Challenge**: Multiple users working on the same project
**Current gap**: No multi-user or versioning support
**Question**: How should creative APIs handle collaborative editing scenarios?
