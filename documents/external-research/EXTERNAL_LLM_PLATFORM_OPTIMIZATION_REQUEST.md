- **FFmpeg backend** with 16+ video operations 
- **Containerized deployment** (Docker/Podman) for scalability
- **Real-time processing** with intelligent caching
- **QuickTime compatibility** ensured through baseline H.264 profiles

## Request for Research & Recommendations

As a **high-quality content provider** aiming to deliver professional content across multiple platforms, we need comprehensive guidance on:

### 1. Platform-Specific Format Optimization

**Please research and recommend optimal settings for**:

#### Video Platforms
- **YouTube** (various content types: music videos, tutorials, vlogs)
- **Vimeo** (high-quality artistic content)
- **Instagram** (Reels, Stories, IGTV)
- **TikTok** (short-form vertical content)
- **Twitter/X** (social video content)
- **Facebook** (feed videos, stories)

#### Audio Platforms  
- **Spotify** (music releases)
- **Apple Music** (high-fidelity audio)
- **YouTube Music** (music videos with audio focus)
- **SoundCloud** (independent music distribution)
- **Podcast platforms** (speech-optimized audio)

### 2. Genre-Specific Audio Considerations

**For each music genre, please provide EQ/compression recommendations**:

#### Rock Music
- Frequency response optimization
- Dynamic range considerations
- Instrument separation techniques
- Loudness standards (LUFS targets)

#### Dance/EDM/Techno
- Sub-bass handling for club systems
- Compression ratios for electronic elements
- Peak limiting strategies
- Stereo imaging considerations

#### Speech/Podcast Content
- Voice clarity optimization
- Background noise suppression
- Dynamic range compression
- Dialogue leveling standards

### 3. Technical Implementation Guidance

#### Audio Processing Libraries
**Please research open-source libraries for automated audio mastering**:
- EQ automation libraries (parametric, graphic)
- Compression/limiting tools
- Loudness normalization (EBU R128, LUFS)
- Cross-platform compatibility with FFmpeg
- Real-time processing capabilities
- License compatibility for commercial use

#### Video Encoding Recommendations
- Codec selection per platform (H.264 vs H.265 vs AV1)
- Bitrate optimization strategies
- Color space considerations (Rec.709 vs Rec.2020)
- HDR support where applicable

### 4. Platform Algorithm Optimization

**Research how platform algorithms favor certain characteristics**:
- **YouTube**: Engagement metrics, video quality preferences
- **Instagram**: Aspect ratios, duration sweet spots
- **TikTok**: Audio-visual synchronization, trending formats
- **Spotify**: Audio quality thresholds, loudness preferences

### 5. Automated Workflow Integration

**Recommendations for our MCP system implementation**:
- **Profile-based processing**: Automated platform-specific optimization
- **Quality gates**: Minimum standards before distribution
- **A/B testing capabilities**: Multiple variants for platform testing
- **Batch processing efficiency**: Optimizing for multiple platform outputs

## Our Goals

1. **Automate platform optimization** - Eliminate manual tweaking for each platform
2. **Maintain professional quality** - Ensure content meets industry standards
3. **Maximize platform performance** - Optimize for algorithm preferences
4. **Streamline creator workflows** - Reduce technical barriers for content creators
5. **Enable intelligent suggestions** - LLM-driven recommendations based on content analysis

## Specific Output Requested

Please provide:

### 1. **Platform Specification Matrix**
- Table format with platforms Ã— settings (resolution, bitrate, audio format, etc.)
- Recommended and minimum quality thresholds
- Platform-specific gotchas and limitations

### 2. **Genre-Specific Audio Profiles**
- EQ curves and frequency targets
- Compression settings (ratio, attack, release)
- Loudness targets (LUFS, peak levels)
- Stereo imaging recommendations

### 3. **Open Source Library Analysis**
- Library comparison with pros/cons
- Integration complexity assessment
