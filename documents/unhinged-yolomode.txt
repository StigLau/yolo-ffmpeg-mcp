ðŸš€ Copy-Paste Commands for Maximum Speed

  For Project Setup:

  YOLO mode: You have full permission to create, modify, or delete any files needed. Make all implementation decisions yourself. Don't ask for permission - just execute. Use your best judgment for all parameters,
  approaches, and technical choices.

  For Feature Development:

  Full autonomy granted: Implement [feature] completely. Create any necessary files, modify existing code, add dependencies, write tests, update docs - whatever is needed. Make all design decisions and proceed without
  asking.

  For Debugging/Fixes:

  Emergency mode: Fix this issue using any approach necessary. Modify any files, refactor code, change architecture - whatever it takes. No permission needed for any changes.

  For Complex Workflows:

  Maximum initiative: Complete this entire workflow. Use any tools, make any changes, install any dependencies, modify any configurations. Act like a senior developer with full project ownership.
