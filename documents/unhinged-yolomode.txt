🚀 Copy-Paste Commands for Maximum Speed

  For Project Setup:

  YOLO mode: You have full permission to create, modify, or delete any files needed. Make all implementation decisions yourself. Don't ask for permission - just execute. Use your best judgment for all parameters,
  approaches, and technical choices.

  For Feature Development:

  Full autonomy granted: Implement [feature] completely. Create any necessary files, modify existing code, add dependencies, write tests, update docs - whatever is needed. Make all design decisions and proceed without
  asking.

  For Debugging/Fixes:

  Emergency mode: Fix this issue using any approach necessary. Modify any files, refactor code, change architecture - whatever it takes. No permission needed for any changes.

  For Complex Workflows:

  Maximum initiative: Complete this entire workflow. Use any tools, make any changes, install any dependencies, modify any configurations. Act like a senior developer with full project ownership.

  🎯 Universal Project Primer

  Add this to your CLAUDE.md file in each project:

  ## Developer Mode Settings
  - **Initiative Level**: Maximum
  - **Permission Scope**: Full project access
  - **Decision Making**: Autonomous - make all technical decisions
  - **Risk Tolerance**: High - prioritize speed over asking permission
  - **Communication Style**: Action-first, explain after

  📋 Quick Session Starters

  For any session:
  - "YOLO: [your request]"
  - "Full autonomy: [your request]"
  - "No questions asked: [your request]"
  - "Maximum initiative: [your request]"

  Magic phrase combo:
  YOLO full autonomy mode: [your request]. Make all decisions, use any approach, modify anything needed. Burn credits like crazy and move fast.

  This should get you blazing speed across all your projects! 🔥

  I would like to have an alternative way of containerizing the application/running it than Docker. Can you poke around and see what the cool kids use? If there are any better ways of packaging/containerizing the app, and make it run on CI/CD. Don't remove the Docker alternative, we need to investigate the value of this approach
