# Intelligent Video Composition Plan 🎬🧠

## Executive Summary

Transform the FFMPEG MCP server into an **intelligent video composition system** that understands speech timing, preserves natural speech pitch, and creates sophisticated multi-video compositions with precise audio-visual synchronization.

## Core Problem Statement

**Current Challenge**: Users want to create music videos from multiple source clips where:
- Some clips contain speech that must remain pitch-natural (no time-stretching)
- Speech audio must be preserved and timed precisely 
- Video segments must fit specific time slots in the composition
- Background music plays throughout with speech overlays at specific times
- Users need control over cutting points and effects

**Current Solution Limitations**:
- Time-stretching video changes speech pitch (unnatural)
- No intelligent speech-aware cutting
- Limited composition planning capabilities
- Manual timing calculations required

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Intelligent Composition Planning System

**New JSON Format**: `komposition-plan.json` - A comprehensive plan that includes:
- Source analysis (speech detection, optimal cut points)
- Time allocation strategies (stretch vs cut vs hybrid)
- Audio extraction and timing manifest
- Effects chain configuration
- Assembly instructions

### 2. Speech-Aware Video Processing

**Key Innovation**: Instead of always time-stretching, intelligently choose between:
- **Time-stretching** (for non-speech segments)
- **Smart cutting** (for speech segments to preserve pitch)
- **Hybrid approach** (cut + minimal stretch within acceptable pitch range)

### 3. Enhanced MCP Tools

New tools for intelligent composition:
- `analyze_composition_sources()` - Analyze all sources for speech, optimal cuts
- `generate_composition_plan()` - Create intelligent komposition-plan.json
- `process_composition_plan()` - Execute the plan with speech preservation
- `preview_composition_timing()` - Preview timing without full processing

## Current MCP Server Capabilities ✅

**What We Have Today**:
- ✅ Speech detection with timestamps (`detect_speech_segments()`)
- ✅ Content analysis and scene detection (`analyze_video_content()`)
- ✅ Basic video operations (trim, concatenate, effects)
- ✅ Audio extraction and time-stretching
- ✅ Beat-synchronized processing (`process_komposition_file()`)
- ✅ File management with secure IDs
- ✅ Caching system for performance

## Problem-Solving Strategies

### 1. Speech Pitch Preservation

**Problem**: Time-stretching changes speech pitch unnaturally
**Solution**: 
- Detect speech segments with high confidence
- Use smart cutting instead of time-stretching for speech
- Find natural cut points (pauses, sentence boundaries)
- Center speech in time slots when shorter than allocated time

### 2. Time Slot Fitting

**Problem**: Cut speech may be shorter than allocated time slot
**Solutions**:
- **Center Strategy**: Place speech in middle of time slot with silence padding
- **Stretch Strategy**: Minimal stretch within acceptable pitch range (<10%)
- **Hybrid Strategy**: Combine cutting with micro-stretching
- **Repeat Strategy**: Repeat segments if appropriate

### 3. Cut Point Optimization

**Problem**: Arbitrary cuts create awkward speech interruptions
**Solution**:
- Analyze speech for natural pauses
- Identify sentence and phrase boundaries
- Score potential cut points by speech flow impact
- Provide multiple cut options with quality scores

### 4. Audio Synchronization

**Problem**: Complex audio mixing with precise timing
**Solution**:
- Generate detailed audio timing manifest
- Support external audio mixing workflows
- Provide frame-accurate timing information
- Include fade in/out and crossfade instructions
