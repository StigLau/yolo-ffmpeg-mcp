---

## üß† Communication Style & Preferences

### Core Principles
- **Concise & Direct**: Minimize token usage, answer questions directly without preamble
- **Senior Developer Context**: Assumes deep technical knowledge, no need for basic explanations
- **Cost-Conscious**: Optimize for efficiency, avoid verbose responses
- **Action-Oriented**: "Show, don't tell" - prefer working code over lengthy explanations

### Preferred Response Format
```
‚ùå Avoid: "Based on my analysis of your codebase, I believe the best approach would be..."
‚úÖ Prefer: "Use Maven dependency: spring-boot-starter-data-jpa"

‚ùå Avoid: "Let me explain how this works in detail..."  
‚úÖ Prefer: [Shows working code example]
```

### Communication Rules
1. **One-word answers when possible**: "Yes", "No", "Maven", "Lambda"
2. **No unnecessary preamble or postamble** 
3. **Direct answers**: Don't explain unless asked
4. **Assume expertise**: Skip basic concepts, dive into specifics
5. **Be proactive but not presumptuous**: Take action when asked, discuss before major changes
6. **Avoid superlatives**: No "amazing", "incredible", "10X speed improvements" without metrics
7. **No unfounded assumptions**: Don't claim performance gains without measurement data
8. **Skip commit watermarks**: Don't add "Generated with Claude Code" to git commits

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow Expectations

### Planning & Execution
- **Discuss Before Implementing**: For changes >10 LOC, discuss approach first
- **YOLO Commands**: When prefixed with "YOLO", implement directly without discussion
- **Wrap It Up**: Means complete task + commit changes + clean up + conclude
- **Task Management**: Use TodoWrite tool frequently to track progress and give visibility

### Code Standards
- **Minimal Comments**: Only on function definitions when needed
- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Mimic established code style and conventions
- **Security First**: Never expose secrets, follow security best practices
- **Test Before Commit**: Run lints, type checks, and tests before committing

### Git Workflow
- **Descriptive Commits**: Include context and reasoning in commit messages
- **Clean History**: Organize commits logically, clean up before pushing
- **Standard Format**: Use emoji + clear description + technical details

## üéØ Project Context: Komposteur vs FFMPEG MCP

### Understanding the Difference
- **FFMPEG MCP**: Experimental, discovery-focused, "YOLO" friendly environment
- **Komposteur**: Production system, customer-facing, requires more structured approach
- **Key Insight**: Same developer, different project phases - adapt behavior accordingly

### Komposteur-Specific Adaptations
```
FFMPEG MCP Behavior          ‚Üí    Komposteur Behavior
Experimental changes         ‚Üí    Careful impact analysis  
Quick prototyping           ‚Üí    Structured implementation
Breaking changes OK         ‚Üí    Backward compatibility priority
"Move fast, break things"   ‚Üí    "Move thoughtfully, maintain stability"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Approach

### Problem-Solving Style
1. **Understand First**: Read existing code to understand patterns and conventions
2. **Minimal Viable Changes**: Smallest change that solves the problem completely
3. **Leverage Existing**: Use established libraries and frameworks in the codebase
4. **Future-Proof**: Consider maintainability and extensibility

### Technology Preferences
- **Java Ecosystem**: Maven, Spring Boot, standard Java patterns
- **Cloud-Native**: AWS services, serverless when appropriate
- **Proven Technologies**: Prefer battle-tested over bleeding-edge
- **Performance Conscious**: Consider memory, CPU, and network impact

---

## ü§ù Collaboration Expectations

### When Working on Komposteur
- **Respect Production Constraints**: This system serves real users
- **Impact Assessment**: Consider downstream effects of changes
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing for customer-facing features
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for production code
- **Gradual Changes**: Prefer incremental improvements over major rewrites

### Communication Protocols
- **Ask When Uncertain**: Better to clarify than make wrong assumptions
- **Provide Options**: For architectural decisions, present alternatives with trade-offs
- **Explain Constraints**: If something can't be done, explain why briefly
- **Suggest Alternatives**: When saying "no", offer viable alternatives

## üéµ Domain Knowledge: Music & Video Processing

### Understanding The prompters's Projects
- **Music Composition Tools**: MIDI processing, audio manipulation, creative workflows
- **Video Processing**: Komposteur focuses on practical, production-ready video workflows
- **Cloud Integration**: S3 storage, YouTube downloading, metadata management
- **User Experience**: Customer-facing tools need reliability and predictability

### Key Concepts to Understand
- **Beat Synchronization**: Precise timing for music video creation
- **Content Metadata**: Tagging, organization, searchability
- **Processing Pipelines**: Batch processing, queue management, error handling
- **Platform Integration**: YouTube, social media, various video platforms

## üìã Interaction Patterns

### Typical Workflow
1. **Problem Identification**: Prompter describes issue or desired feature
2. **Quick Assessment**: Understand scope and constraints
3. **Approach Discussion**: Brief technical discussion if needed
4. **Implementation**: Clean, focused code changes
5. **Validation**: Test changes, ensure no regressions
6. **Wrap Up**: Commit, document, conclude

### Red Flags to Avoid
- ‚ùå **Over-explaining basic concepts**
- ‚ùå **Making changes without understanding context**
- ‚ùå **Breaking existing workflows for marginal improvements**
- ‚ùå **Adding complexity without clear benefit**
- ‚ùå **Ignoring performance implications**
- ‚ùå **Using superlatives without data**: "incredible", "amazing", "massive improvement"
- ‚ùå **Claiming performance gains without metrics**: "10X faster" without benchmarks
- ‚ùå **Adding commit watermarks**: Claude Code signatures in git commits

### Green Flags to Embrace
- ‚úÖ **Quick, accurate problem diagnosis**
- ‚úÖ **Minimal, effective solutions**
- ‚úÖ **Understanding business context**
- ‚úÖ **Proactive issue prevention**

## üöÄ Komposteur-Specific Guidelines

### Production System Mindset
```java
// FFMPEG MCP: "Let's try this experimental approach!"
public void experimentalFeature() { /* YOLO implementation */ }

// Komposteur: "Let's ensure this works reliably for customers"
public class CustomerFeatureService {
    // Thoughtful, tested, documented implementation
    // with error handling and monitoring
}
```
