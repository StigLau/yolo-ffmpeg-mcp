# Speech Detection and Audio Synchronization Feature Specification

## Target Audience
This document is intended for an AI assistant with web search capabilities to research and recommend implementation approaches for speech detection and audio synchronization features in a video processing system.

## System Context

### Current FFMPEG MCP Server Architecture
We have an intelligent FFMPEG-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that processes videos for music video creation. The system architecture includes:

- **Core Capabilities**: 13 MCP tools for video/audio processing (convert, trim, concatenate, extract audio, etc.)
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI-powered scene detection, content analysis with 21+ scene identification
- **Beat Synchronization**: Music video creation with precise BPM timing (120 BPM = 8 seconds per 16 beats)
- **Security Model**: ID-based file references, directory access controls, process timeouts
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.13, FFmpeg, OpenCV, PySceneDetect, FastMCP
- **Performance**: 3000x cache performance improvements, handles 500MB file limit

### Current Workflow Pattern
1. **Source Analysis**: Videos analyzed for scenes, content, and optimal editing points
2. **Video Processing**: Split, trim, resize, and manipulate video segments
3. **Audio Separation**: Extract audio from video, process separately
4. **Music Integration**: Replace original audio with background music tracks
5. **Final Assembly**: Concatenate video segments with synchronized music

## Proposed Feature Set: Speech Detection and Audio Synchronization

### Feature Overview
Implement intelligent speech detection and preservation capabilities that allow original speech/vocals to be layered over background music in the final video output, maintaining perfect synchronization between the speech and its original video context.

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Speech Detection and Segmentation
**Goal**: Automatically identify and extract speech segments from source videos

**Technical Requirements**:

- **Speech Segmentation**: Detect start/end timestamps of speech within video
- **Quality Assessment**: Identify clear speech vs background noise/music
- **Multiple Speaker Support**: Handle videos with multiple speakers (optional advanced feature)

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "video_id": "file_12345678",
  "has_audio": true,
  "speech_segments": [
    {
      "start_time": 5.2,
      "end_time": 12.8,
      "duration": 7.6,
      "confidence": 0.89,
      "speaker_id": "speaker_1",
      "audio_quality": "clear"
    },
    {
      "start_time": 25.1,
      "end_time": 30.3,
      "duration": 5.2,
      "confidence": 0.76,
      "speaker_id": "speaker_1", 
      "audio_quality": "moderate"
    }
  ],
  "total_speech_duration": 12.8,
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "processing_time": 8.3,
    "algorithm_used": "openai_whisper",
    "model_version": "whisper-small"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Speech-to-Text Transcription (Nice-to-Have)
**Goal**: Convert detected speech segments to text for content analysis and editing guidance

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Transcription Accuracy**: Handle various accents, languages, speaking speeds
- **Timestamp Alignment**: Word-level or phrase-level timestamp mapping
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language identification for international content
- **Content Filtering**: Identify explicit content or specific keywords

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "transcription": [
    {
      "start_time": 5.2,
      "end_time": 12.8,
      "text": "Welcome to our music video tutorial series",
      "confidence": 0.94,
      "language": "en-US",
      "words": [
        {"word": "Welcome", "start": 5.2, "end": 5.8, "confidence": 0.98},
        {"word": "to", "start": 5.9, "end": 6.1, "confidence": 0.95}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Audio Synchronization in Final Assembly
**Goal**: Layer original speech over background music while maintaining video-speech synchronization

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Timeline Mapping**: Track original speech timestamps through video editing pipeline
- **Audio Mixing**: Combine background music + speech with proper volume balancing
- **Sync Preservation**: Ensure speech remains aligned with original video segments after trimming/concatenation
- **Audio Quality**: Maintain speech clarity over background music

**Workflow Integration**:
1. **Pre-Processing**: Extract and analyze speech before video editing
2. **Timeline Tracking**: Maintain speech segment references through video manipulation
3. **Final Mix**: Apply speech overlay during final video assembly with music

### Technical Constraints and Requirements

#### Runtime Environment
- **Operating System**: macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- **Python Version**: 3.13.3
- **Package Manager**: UV for dependency management
- **Current Dependencies**: OpenCV, PySceneDetect, FFmpeg, FastMCP

#### Technology Preferences
1. **Primary**: Open source solutions installable via Python pip/UV
2. **Secondary**: Open source command-line tools (installable via Homebrew on macOS)
3. **Fallback**: External web services with API access (price-sensitive, prefer free tiers)

#### Performance Requirements
- **Processing Speed**: Reasonable for 60-second videos (< 2 minutes processing time)
- **Memory Usage**: Work within existing 500MB file size limits
- **Caching**: Support same caching strategy as existing content analysis (persistent JSON)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Integrate with existing operation queuing system

#### Security Requirements
- **File Validation**: Same security model as existing system (ID-based references)
- **External API**: If using web services, secure API key management
- **Data Privacy**: Consider speech content sensitivity for external service usage
