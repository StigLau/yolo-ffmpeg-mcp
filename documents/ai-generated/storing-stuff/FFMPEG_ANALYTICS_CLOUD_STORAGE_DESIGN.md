# FFMPEG Analytics & Komposition Cloud Storage System - Design Document

## Problem Statement & Strategic Objectives

### Current Challenge
The FFMPEG MCP system has evolved into a sophisticated video processing platform with complex workflows, but lacks:

1. **Operation Analytics**: No tracking of which FFMPEG operations are most popular or effective
2. **User Workflow Storage**: Kompositions are created locally without cloud persistence or user isolation
3. **Pattern Recognition**: No learning mechanism to identify and optimize common usage patterns
4. **Abuse Prevention**: No user tracking for system misuse detection
5. **Knowledge Extraction**: Valuable workflow insights are lost rather than captured for system improvement

### Strategic Vision
Transform the current local processing system into a cloud-native analytics platform that:
- **Learns** from user behavior to improve operation recommendations
- **Stores** user kompositions with proper IP protection and isolation
- **Tracks** system usage for both optimization and abuse prevention
- **Scales** across both MCP system and Komposteur platforms
- **Evolves** by converting popular patterns into named, optimized operations

## System Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tier Data Strategy

#### Tier 1: User-Specific Data (IP Protected)
- **Kompositions**: User-created video composition workflows
- **Personal Templates**: User-saved operation chains and presets
- **Project Files**: User-uploaded source materials and outputs

#### Tier 2: System-Wide Analytics (Learning Data)
- **Operation Usage Patterns**: Which FFMPEG operations are used together
- **Workflow Sequences**: Common operation chains and their success rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing times, error rates, resource utilization
- **User Behavior**: Anonymous usage patterns for system optimization

### Google Cloud Storage Solutions Analysis

#### For Kompositions & User Data: Cloud Firestore
**Advantages:**
- Document-based storage perfect for JSON kompositions
- Built-in user authentication integration
- Real-time synchronization capabilities
- Automatic scaling and regional distribution
- Strong security rules for user data isolation

**Data Model:**
```
/users/{userId}/
  /kompositions/{kompositionId}
  /templates/{templateId}
  /projects/{projectId}
  /preferences/settings
```

#### For Analytics Data: BigQuery + Cloud Storage
**Analytics Pipeline:**
- **Cloud Storage**: Raw operation logs and event data
- **BigQuery**: Structured analytics queries and pattern analysis
- **Cloud Functions**: Real-time processing of usage events
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: Event streaming for real-time analytics

### Authentication Strategy

#### OAuth 2.0 + Google Identity Platform
**Implementation:**
- Google OAuth for seamless user login
- Firebase Authentication for session management
- Service account authentication for system-to-system calls
- JWT tokens for API authorization

**User Identity Flow:**
1. User authenticates via Google OAuth
2. System generates Firebase custom token
3. All data operations scoped to authenticated user ID
4. Anonymous analytics data strips user identification

## Data Models & Storage Patterns

    // Full komposition JSON structure
  },
  "sharing": {
    "visibility": "private|public|shared",
    "sharedWith": ["user_ids"]
  }
}
```

### Analytics Event Schema
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "iso_timestamp",
  "userId": "hashed_user_id", // For abuse tracking only
  "platform": "mcp|komposteur",
  "eventType": "operation|workflow|error",
  "operation": {
    "type": "ffmpeg_operation_name",
    "parameters": "sanitized_params",
    "duration": "processing_time_ms",
    "success": boolean,
    "resourceUsage": {
      "cpu": "usage_percent",
      "memory": "usage_mb",
      "disk": "io_operations"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "workflowStage": "position_in_sequence",
    "sourceFileType": "video|audio|image",
    "outputFormat": "target_format",
    "fileSize": "approximate_size_category"
  }
}
```
