implementation:
  scatter: "Distribute video segments to worker instances"
  process: "Parallel encoding/transformation on distributed workers"
  gather: "Collect results and combine into final output"
services:
  aws: "Step Functions + Lambda + MediaConvert"
  gcp: "Workflows + Cloud Functions + Video Intelligence"
  azure: "Logic Apps + Functions + Media Services"
```

#### 2. Pipeline Pattern
