ðŸŽ¬ MCP Video Server Testing Report
Successfully Created:
An upbeat music video with 8 distinct segments, each 4 seconds long (approximately 8 beats at 120 BPM), totaling 31.4 seconds with different visual effects applied to each segment.
Final Result:

File ID: file_4535d588 (temp_ca70d653.mp4)
Duration: 31.37 seconds
Resolution: 1920x1080 (HD)
Size: 20.1 MB
Audio: ZeroSoul.flac background music
Effects Applied: Leica look, enhanced Leica, reverse effects across 8 segments


ðŸ”§ Experience as an LLM Using the MCP Server
âœ… What Worked Well:

File Discovery: list_files() provided excellent overview with smart suggestions
Batch Processing: batch_process() handled multiple operations efficiently
Sequential Operations: Individual process_file() calls worked reliably
Effect Integration: Built-in leica_look and leica_look_enhanced effects produced professional results
Audio Integration: replace_audio seamlessly added background music
File Management: get_file_info() provided detailed metadata

ðŸš§ Challenges and Issues:

Atomic Function Limitations:

create_video_from_description() failed with unclear file reference errors
generate_komposition_from_description() didn't respect the 8-scene structure requested


Video Effects System Issues:

apply_video_effect() failed with 'FileManager' object has no attribute 'get_file_path' error
Had to use built-in FFmpeg operations instead of the advanced effects system


Batch Processing Limitations:

OUTPUT_PREVIOUS chaining in batch_process() didn't work reliably
Had to fall back to manual step-by-step concatenation


Parameter Handling:

Some operations required precise parameter formatting (e.g., resize needed exact parameter names)



ðŸ”„ Retry Strategy Required:

Initial Approach: Tried atomic create_video_from_description() â†’ Failed
Second Approach: Used generate_komposition_from_description() â†’ Partial success but wrong structure
Final Approach: Manual workflow with individual operations â†’ Success

Total Function Calls Used: ~25+ calls to achieve the desired result
ðŸ’¡ Recommendations for MCP Server Developer:

Fix Critical Bugs:

apply_video_effect() file path resolution
OUTPUT_PREVIOUS chaining in batch operations
File reference resolution in atomic functions


Improve Error Messages:

More specific error descriptions for file reference issues
Better parameter validation feedback


Enhance Atomic Functions:

Make create_video_from_description() more robust with better NLP parsing
Allow finer control over segment structure and timing


Documentation:

Clearer examples of parameter formatting
Expected file naming conventions



ðŸŽ¯ Overall Assessment:
Despite the challenges, the MCP server successfully delivered a high-quality music video. The manual workflow approach proved most reliable, allowing for precise control over each step. The server excels at:

Individual operations (trim, concatenate, audio replacement)
Built-in effects (Leica looks, reverse effects)
File management and metadata
Audio-video synchronization

The atomic functions need improvement but the core video processing capabilities are solid and professional-grade. The server would benefit from bug fixes in the advanced features while maintaining the excellent foundation of individual operations.
Final Grade: B+ - Great core functionality with room for improvement in advanced features.
