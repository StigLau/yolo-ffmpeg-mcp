# Cloud-First Video Processing Platform: Executive Summary

## Project Overview
Build a state-managed, web-centric video processing platform that integrates existing Elm komposition editor with modern cloud infrastructure, distributed workers, and LLM assistance.

## Key Constraints & Requirements
- **Existing Asset**: Elm komposition editor (must be preserved and integrated)
- **Cloud-First**: Scalable distributed processing with cost optimization
- **State Visibility**: Real-time tracking of komposition processing status
- **LLM Integration**: Restricted domain assistance for video/music composition
- **Cost Optimization**: 60-90% savings through preemptible instances

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. State Management: Google Cloud Workflows ✅
- **Cost**: FREE tier covers typical workloads (5000 steps/month)
- **Integration**: HTTP-based, perfect for MCP server integration
- **Scalability**: Up to 1-year execution duration
- **Pattern**: Scatter-gather for distributed video processing

### 2. Frontend: React + Elm Hybrid ✅
- **Elm Editor**: Preserved as React component via react-elm-components
- **React Shell**: Authentication, file management, progress tracking
- **Communication**: Ports/flags for clean integration boundaries
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for progress updates

### 3. Infrastructure: Cloud Run + Preemptible VMs ✅
- **Workers**: 80% preemptible + 20% regular instances
- **Auto-scaling**: KEDA-based queue depth scaling
- **Checkpointing**: 30-second intervals for fault tolerance
- **Cost**: 60-90% savings vs regular instances

### 4. Security: Multi-layer LLM Protection ✅
- **Domain Restriction**: Video/music composition only
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization pipeline
- **MCP Proxy**: Sandboxed access to approved operations
- **Cost Control**: Usage quotas and monitoring

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: State Management Foundation
- Deploy Google Cloud Workflows for komposition tracking
- Create REST API for status queries
- Set up basic worker queue with Cloud Tasks
- Implement checkpointing and recovery

### Phase 2: Hybrid Frontend
- Build React shell application
- Integrate existing Elm editor via ports/flags
- Implement WebSocket real-time updates
- Add file upload and management interface

### Phase 3: Distributed Processing
- Deploy auto-scaling worker pool with preemptible VMs
- Implement intelligent caching with backwards dependency resolution
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Optimize cost through usage analytics

### Phase 4: LLM Integration
- Deploy restricted LLM with domain-specific prompting
- Implement secure MCP server proxy
- Add natural language komposition interface
- Monitor and control usage costs

## Expected Outcomes
- **Cost Reduction**: 60-90% through preemptible instances and intelligent caching
- **Real-time Visibility**: Complete komposition processing transparency
- **Preserved Investment**: Elm editor maintained with modern tooling integration
- **Natural Language Interface**: LLM-assisted komposition editing for non-technical users
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle concurrent processing with auto-scaling workers

## Success Metrics
- Processing cost per komposition
- Average komposition completion time
- User satisfaction with real-time visibility
- LLM assistance adoption rate
- System uptime and reliability

This comprehensive plan balances cost optimization, technical innovation, and practical constraints while preserving existing investments and enabling future growth.
