+can you use the MCP server in this project?

# 2025-06-13 21:47:21.662326
+Read through the project documentation and generate the context files so Aider understands what the project is about at startup and loads faster, have a look through all the files of this project

# 2025-06-13 21:59:00.819753
+what did you learn?

# 2025-06-13 22:01:36.896475
+Have we written the context files Aider likes to consume for getting to grips with the project?

+I want you to interact with the MCP server and use it only. With it I want you to build a music video with the speed of 120 BPM and have the video last for 128 beats. You should use the snippets you find from the scenes we have from the video metadata and compose a nice history based on the snippets being played for 8 beats each. Choose one of the songs for backing music. If possible, I want the video to have a rough Leica look. Report back if you see issues or improvement proposals with the MCP Server API

# 2025-06-13 22:19:31.713255
+can you please implement what you proposed? I want to evaluate the resulting music video

+can you not let the MCP server be available to the LLM through Aider?

+I want make the mcp server produced by this project available to Claude Desktop, edit the Claude config file or show me the configuration you would want to place there?
