# Summary

PoC of wrapping FFMPEG and packaging it as Music Video scriptable from natural language. IE, how one can leverage existing libraries and APIs to be accessible to LLMs, do API discovery and find new use cases.
Working with a developer-LLM (Claude Code) which has access to the project, it can easily append functionality to the system, while running in "standard mode" - The end user talks to Claude Desktop which in turn talks to the MCP server, wrapping FFMPEG and other libraries. Standard mode is restricted by the functionality that was created up until now, but the LLM/Claude Desktop can find new usages of the provided functinality

# FFMPEG MCP Server ðŸŽ¬

An intelligent video editing MCP server with AI-powered content analysis, speech detection, and automated music video creation.

## What is this?

This is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that lets AI assistants like Claude create, edit, and analyze videos using FFMPEG. Think of it as giving your AI assistant "eyes" to understand video content and "hands" to edit videos intelligently.

**Perfect for**: Music video creation, content analysis, automated editing, speech-synchronized videos, and intelligent video processing workflows.

## Quick Start ðŸš€

### For Claude Code Users
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Add to Claude Code Configuration**
   
   Edit your Claude Code MCP configuration file:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "ffmpeg-mcp": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "src.server"],
         "cwd": "/path/to/yolo-ffmpeg-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start Using**
   - Place video files in `/tmp/music/source/`
   - Ask Claude to create music videos, analyze content, or edit videos
   - Find generated videos in `/tmp/music/temp/`

### For Aider Users
```bash
# Start MCP server in background
uv run python -m src.server &

# Use with Aider for video editing workflows
aider --mcp-server localhost:8000
```

### Docker Setup (Production)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
./build-docker.sh run

# Development mode with MCP Inspector
./build-docker.sh dev
```

## Example Workflows ðŸŽ¬

### Create a Music Video
```
"Create a 30-second music video using lookin.mp4 and panning.mp4 with background music at 135 BPM"
```

### Analyze Video Content  
```
"Analyze this video and suggest the best 10-second clip for social media"
```

### Speech-Synchronized Video
```
"Extract speech from intro.mp4 and layer it over background music while keeping the original speech clear"
```
